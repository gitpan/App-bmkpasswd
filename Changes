Revision history for App::bmkpasswd

1.03  2012-06-08

  croak() if specified work cost factor is not numeric.
  
  croak() on unknown types.

  Clean up an old check that is no longer relevant; have_sha() will now 
  do the Right Thing if Crypt::Passwd::XS is missing, so we don't need 
  to check if someone was stupidly futzing with package variables.

1.02 2012-06-08

  OCD.
