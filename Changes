# Revision history for App::bmkpasswd

1.081002  (17 Feb 2013)

  Fix stray reference to deprecated HAVE_PASSWD_XS in bin/bmkpasswd

1.081001  (17 Feb 2013)

  Use Crypt::Random::Seed in blocking mode to generate salts securely.
  This means that mkpasswd operations could block on low-entropy
  systems.

  Switch to dzil & semantic versioning



1.07  2012-06-10

  Slightly more sane Crypt::Passwd::XS checking.

  Improved POD.

1.06  2012-06-09

  Small t/ readability cleanup.

  Missing changelog for 1.05.

1.05  2012-06-09

  Skip MD5 tests on systems without Crypt::Passwd::XS or working MD5.

  Fixes test failures on Windows builds without proper crypt(),
  MD5 is only included for compat with ancient hashes anyway.

1.04  2012-06-09

  Fix a broken test on systems missing SHA support.

  More consistent POD between bmkpasswd(1) and App::bmkpasswd

1.03  2012-06-08

  croak() if specified work cost factor is not numeric.
  
  croak() on unknown types.

  Clean up an old check that is no longer relevant; have_sha() will now 
  do the Right Thing if Crypt::Passwd::XS is missing, so we don't need 
  to check if someone was stupidly futzing with package variables.

1.02 2012-06-08

  Typo/style cleanups; non-fatal but aggravating my OCD.



1.01 2012-06-08

  - Use Try::Tiny rather than raw block eval
  - Use strictures
  - Improved tests

1.00 2012-05-23

  - Minor cleanups, 1.00

0.05 2012-04-07

 Minor fixes:

  - t/04_sha: mention Crypt::Passwd::XS if SHA is missing
  - Include . / in standard salt possibles (MD5/SHA)
  - croak() rather than die() from bmkpasswd.pm

0.04 2012-04-02

  Don't export mkpasswd/passwdcmp unless requested.

0.03 2012-03-29

  First known-working CPAN-able dist.
  Based on code pulled out of the Cobalt2 IRC bot, with:
   - POD updates
   - Optional Crypt::Passwd::XS detection/use
   - Tests
